use make to build files.
goto server directory, run ./app_server to start the server.
goto client directory, run ./app_client to start the client, 
you will input the server hostname to connect to the server.

In client directory:
	app_client.c - client application source file
	srt_client.c - str client side  source file
 	srt_client.h - srt client header file	
  We have provided skeleton srt_client.c and .h files, you need
	to fill in the functions in the .c file to implement srt client 
In server directory:
	app_server.c - server application source file
	srt_server.c - srt server side source file
	srt_server.h - srt server header file
  We have provided skeleton srt_server.c and .h files, you need
	to fill in the functions in the .c file to implement srt server
In common directory:
	seg.h - segment header file
	seg.c - segment source file
	constants.h - constants used by SRT

Note from Student :- 
		
		1. I have tested it by running app_server.o in tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu:39008 and app_cleint.o in my personal PC. 
		2. All the stated are printed in terminal through printf.
		3. It will also work by running app_server.o and app_client.o on two different terminal on same machine.
