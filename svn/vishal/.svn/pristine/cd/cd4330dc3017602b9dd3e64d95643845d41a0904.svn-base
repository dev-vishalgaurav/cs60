Implement the various functions in the different directories.  The
app_{simple/stress}_{client/server}.c are provided to you to test.  
Some functions you have already implemented in previous labs.

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

4 machines are used: bear, green, spruce, gile

Use make to compile. 
To run the application:
1, start the overlay processes:
	At each node, goto overlay directory: run ./overlay&
	The overlay processes on 4 nodes should be started within 1 min.
	wait until you see: waiting connection from network layer on all the nodes.
2. start the network processes: 
	At each node, goto network directory: run ./network&
	wait until you see: waiting for connection from SRT process on all the nodes.
3. start the transport processes and run the application:
	AT one node, goto server dicrectory: run ./app_simple_app or ./app_stress_app
	At another node, goto client directory: run ./app_simple_app or ./app_stress_app

To stop the program:
use kill -s 2 processID to kill the network processes and overlay processes

If the port numbers used by the program are used already, the program exits.

Note to TA :- 
	1.	Please run the program from root folder ./overlay/overlay and ./network/network. 
		After running overlay (ON) process it will print "!! START SNP LAYER !!" and then you should start all the network layers for each terminal.
		As per the skeleton killing the overlay process will kill the network layer as well but killing network layer will not kill overlay. network layer will get binded to overylay each time it is started.
	2.	Run the test client and server from their respective root directory. such as cd client and then execute ./app_simple_client
