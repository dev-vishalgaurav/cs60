1. Open terminal and go to code directory.
2. type make and press enter
3. it will generate 3 executables assignment1_client, assignment1_server, assignment1_server_data
4. assignment1_client will work as required by assignemnt.
5. to communicate with assignment1_server & assignment1_server_data you need to telnet to (localhost 55123)  for main server and (localhost 55512) to communicate with data server. 
	
	localhost means the machine on which its running if its running in tahoe then localhost should be replaced with tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu

	a. run assignment1_server_data  assignment1_server on 2 different terminals. 
	b. from a new terminal use telnet to communicate with these servers as shown below.

		for ex : 
			<For main server>
			telent localhost 55123
			AUTH secretpassword
			CONNECT localhost 55512 networks

			<For data server>
			telent localhost 55512
			AUTH netwroks
			SUCCESS
			WATER TEMPERATURE
			1459385146 173 F
			CLOSE
			BYE

Note
 1. each executable should be run in a separate terminal.
 2. if its running in tahoe then localhost should be replaced to tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu.
