use make to build

The 4 hosts used to build overlay network is
bear.cs.dartmouth.edu
spruce.cs.dartmouth.edu
gile.cs.dartmouth.edu
green.cs.dartmouth.edu

The overlay process should be running on these four hosts
to start overlay on a host:
goto overlay directory and run ./overlay&
All overlay process should be started within 1 min.

After all the overlay processes are started, start the network processes on all 4 nodes.
The network process should be started after the local overlay network is initialized and 
shows "Overlay: waiting for connection from SNP process..."
to start network layer on a host:
goto network directory and run ./network

To kill the overlay processes and network processes: use kill -s 2 processID

If the ports used by the program are used already, the program will exit.


Note to TA :- 
	Please run the program from root folder ./overlay/overlay and ./network/network. 
	After running overlay (ON) process it will print "!! START SNP LAYER !!" and then you should start all the network layers for each terminal.
	As per the skeleton killing the overlay process will kill the network layer as well but killing network layer will not kill overlay. network layer will get binded to overylay each time it is started.
